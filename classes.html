                Private group classes are wonderful for corporate wellness events, bachelor/bacherlorette parties, groups of friends or family who would like to learn yoga privately.
              </p>
              <p>
                Other than being able to choose your preferred date and time, the beauty of a private group class is being able to choose your own learning partners. This could be an opportunity for weekly family or corporate bonding or even improving relationships through the exploration of yoga. You can create a themed class if you'd like for more added fun.
