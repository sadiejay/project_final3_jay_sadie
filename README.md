## Resources

### References
* [Flexbox reference](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
  * I used flexbox in this project and to understand properties I used this site.

* [Email tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_address.asp)
  * Research how to handle email addresses.

* [jQuery Opacity Change](http://www.jquerybyexample.net/2012/05/how-to-change-image-opacity-on.html)
  * Research how to change opacity of background.

* [Text Shadows](https://designshack.net/articles/css/12-fun-css-text-shadows-you-can-copy-and-paste/)
  * I like going here and picking a text shadow. I chose the first one.

### jQuery plugins
* [SVGMagic](http://dirkgroenen.nl/SVGMagic/index.html)
  * "SVGMagic is a simple jQuery plugin that searches for SVG images (including background- and inline dataimages) on your website and creates PNG versions if the browser doesn't support SVG." I have svg images for sm icons and found this plugin!


* [Backstretch](https://github.com/jquery-backstretch/jquery-backstretch)
  * "Backstretch is a simple jQuery plugin that allows you to add a dynamically-resized, slideshow-capable background image to any page or element. The image will stretch to fit the page/element, and will automatically resize as the window/element size changes." I used the plugin on my headers to make the background responsive.


### Custom JS
* [Khan Academy Event Listener Practice](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css-js/html-js-dom-events/p/challenge-cat-clicker)
  * I used this practice to model my JS. I changed the target and variable names.

### Notes
* I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.
* I wanted the background opacity to change but I couldn't figure that out and settled on having the headers change.
* **UPDATE: I figured it out!! I needed
 ``` overflow:hidden;```**
I couldn't figure out how to make everything neatly appear on the page at bigger sizes, especially with the photos getting blown up despite calling a max-width and height.
